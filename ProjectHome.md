This is a lightweight, simple application to view data logged from Garmin devices (.fit and .tcx files). Google Map view, data graphs, statistics, totals etc. A simple alternative to GoldenCheetah and SportsTracks, and many many times better than GarminTrainingCenter. Offline alternative to mapmyride.com, Garmin Connect and Starva.<br>
<br>
Version 1.4 released (Feb 2013)! Several minor fixes and feature updates. Major bug fix for Windows Vista/7 log file handling.<br>
<br>
Note: tested only for Windows XP and Windows 7 with Garmin Edge 500 files.<br>
